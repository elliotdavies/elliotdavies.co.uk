  <p>I'm an engineer at <a href="https://www.habito.com/">Habito</a>, using Haskell and PureScript to build the UK's first digital mortgage adviser.</p>

  <p>From 2015-18 I was a full-stack JavaScript developer at <a href="https://medium.com/digital-times">The Times</a> of London, where I built tools for journalists and editors to use in the newsroom.</p>

  <p>I'm also involved in supporting the next generation of journalists as a trustee of the <a href="http://spajournalism.com">Student Publication Association</a>, the UK's national body for student newspapers and magazines.</p>
